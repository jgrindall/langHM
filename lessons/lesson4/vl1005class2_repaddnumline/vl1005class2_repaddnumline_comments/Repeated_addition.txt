Repeated Addition on the Number line:

Activity:

1. Please remove the 2 stars lying at the end of the scene.

2. Can we show the answer for the number of jumps and length of each jump after 2 wrong attempts?

    It might be quite annoying for the kid to keep trying repeatedly.

3. Can we show the 1, 2, 3, on the jumps? Similarly the length of the jumps can be shown for

   reinforcing the concept.

4. Can we have some easy questions at the first?  It will motivate them to do better.

5. Within a set of 10, some numbers repeat. Can this be changed?

6.  When the figure shows, zero, it asks how many tails are there? Where all the tails?

      How come the number of jumps is 1? Can these zeros be in the first few attempts?

Introduction:

1. Can the first callout appear slowly. It gives a good feeling.

2. Instead of "Let's do repeated addition", we can say "we need to do repeated addition".

   Or this can be a question.... What do you think should be done?

   Then we can say Let's do repeated addition.

3. Slow down the animation for the jumps that hopper makes.(First time)

4. Similarly for the length of each jump. Infact the number can be retained.

5. Similalry the new texts can come slowly...... 

6. The animations, highlightings can be slow. The kids need to get it into their mind.

7. The end is abrupt. Can it end with "Now try out the activity"?
